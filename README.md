## Overview: Streamline Your Educational Content Translation

Language barriers significantly hinder access to valuable educational resources and technical knowledge for learners and developers worldwide. This limits participation and slows down the pace of global innovation and learning.

**Co-op Translator** was born from the need to address the inefficient manual translation process for Microsoft's own large-scale educational series (like the "For Beginners" guides). It has evolved into an easy-to-use, powerful tool designed to break down these barriers for everyone. By providing high-quality automated translations via CLI and GitHub Actions, Co-op Translator empowers educators, students, researchers, and developers globally to share and access knowledge without language constraints.

See how Co-op Translator organizes translated educational content:

![Example](./imgs/translation-ex.png)

Markdown files and image text are automatically translated and neatly organized into language-specific folders.

**Unlock global access to your educational content with Co-op Translator today!**

## Supporting Global Access for Microsoft's Learning Resources

Co-op Translator helps bridge the language gap for key Microsoft educational initiatives, automating the translation process for repositories that serve a global developer community. Examples currently using Co-op Translator include:

   - Delete any old translation files to start fresh
   - This ensures no conflicts with the new translation process

### Quick Start: Command Line

For a fast start using the command line:

1. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

1. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    .venv\scripts\activate
    ```

    - On Linux/macOS:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install the package:

    ```bash
    pip install co-op-translator
    ```

1. Configure Credentials:

    - Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory.
    - Copy the contents from the [.env.template](./.env.template) file into your new `.env` file.
    - Fill in the required API keys and endpoint information in your `.env` file.

1. Run Translation:
    - Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal.
    - Execute the translate command, specifying target languages with the `-l` flag:

    ```bash
    translate -l "ko ja fr"
    ```

    _(Replace `"ko ja fr"` with your desired space-separated language codes)_

### Detailed Usage Guides

Choose the approach that best fits your workflow:

#### 1. Using the Command Line (CLI)

- Best for: One-time translations, manual control, or integration into custom scripts.
- Requires: Local installation of Python and the `co-op-translator` package.
- Guide: [Command Line Guide](./getting_started/command-line-guide/command-line-guide.md)

#### 2. Using GitHub Actions (Automation)

- Best for: Automatically translating content whenever changes are pushed to your repository. Keeps translations consistently up-to-date.
- Requires: Setting up a workflow file (`.github/workflows`) in your repository. No local installation needed.
- Guides:
  - [GitHub Actions Guide (Public Repositories & Standard Secrets)](./getting_started/github-actions-guide/github-actions-guide-public.md) - Use this for most public or personal repositories relying on standard repository secrets.
  - [GitHub Actions Guide (Microsoft Organization Repos & Org-Level Setups)](./getting_started/github-actions-guide/github-actions-guide-org.md) - Use this guide if you are working within the Microsoft GitHub organization or need to leverage organization-level secrets or runners.

## Responsible AI

Microsoft is committed to helping our customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing our learnings, and building trust-based partnerships through tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. Many of these resources can be found at [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).
Microsoft's approach to responsible AI is grounded in our AI principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Large-scale natural language, image, and speech models - like the ones used in this sample - can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive, in turn causing harms. Please consult the [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) to be informed about risks and limitations.

The recommended approach to mitigating these risks is to include a safety system in your architecture that can detect and prevent harmful behavior. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) provides an independent layer of protection, able to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. We also have an interactive Content Safety Studio that allows you to view, explore and try out sample code for detecting harmful content across different modalities. The following [quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) guides you through making requests to the service.

Another aspect to take into account is the overall application performance. With multi-modal and multi-models applications, we consider performance to mean that the system performs as you and your users expect, including not generating harmful outputs. It's important to assess the performance of your overall application using [generation quality and risk and safety metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in).

You can evaluate your AI application in your development environment using the [prompt flow SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). Given either a test dataset or a target, your generative AI application generations are quantitatively measured with built-in evaluators or custom evaluators of your choice. To get started with the prompt flow sdk to evaluate your system, you can follow the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). Once you execute an evaluation run, you can [visualize the results in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).
