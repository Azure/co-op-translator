# Create the *.env* file in the root directory

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up your environment variables for Azure services using an *.env* file. Environment variables allow you to securely manage sensitive credentials, such as API keys, without hard-coding them into your codebase.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Only one language model service (Azure OpenAI or OpenAI) needs to be configured. Fill in the environment variables for your preferred service. If environment variables for multiple language models are set, the co-op translator will select one based on priority.
> - If Computer Vision environment variables are not set, the translator will automatically switch to [Markdown-only mode](./markdown-only-mode.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This guide primarily focuses on Azure services, but you can choose any supported language model from the [supported models and services list](../README.md#-supported-models-and-services).

## Create the *.env* file

In the root directory of your project, create a file named *.env*. This file will store all your environment variables in a simple format.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not commit your *.env* file to version control systems like Git. Add *.env* to your .gitignore file to prevent accidental commits.

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

1. Create an *.env* file in the root directory of your project.

1. Open the *.env* file and paste the following template:

    ```plaintext
    # Azure Credentials
    AZURE_AI_SERVICE_API_KEY="your_azure_ai_service_api_key"
    AZURE_AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT="https://your_azure_ai_service_endpoint"

    # Azure OpenAI Credentials
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_azure_openai_api_key"
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your_azure_openai_endpoint"
    AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your_deployment_name"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="your_api_version"

    # OpenAI Credentials
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    OPENAI_ORG_ID="your_openai_org_id"
    OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_ID="your_chat_model_id(ex. gpt-4o)"
    OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1 (If you don't have a custom base URL, you can delete this lin, then it will use the default base URL)"
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to find your API keys and endpoints, you can refer to [set-up-azure-ai.md](../set-up-azure-ai.md).
