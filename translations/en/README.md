## Overview: Streamline Your Educational Content Translation

Language barriers significantly limit access to valuable educational resources and technical knowledge for learners and developers worldwide. This restricts participation and slows the pace of global innovation and learning.

**Co-op Translator** was created to solve the inefficient manual translation process for Microsoft's large educational series (such as the "For Beginners" guides). It has grown into an easy-to-use, powerful tool designed to break down these barriers for everyone. By providing high-quality automated translations via CLI and GitHub Actions, Co-op Translator enables educators, students, researchers, and developers around the world to share and access knowledge without language restrictions.

See how Co-op Translator organizes translated educational content:

![Example](../../translated_images/translation-ex.e97fcdf09d27f56060939080a0b3e491e92b67e047ca005826cb3de11399907c.en.png)

Markdown files and image text are automatically translated and neatly organized into language-specific folders.

### Initial Setup

Before starting, set up the following resources:

1. Language Model Resource (Required):
   - Azure OpenAI (Recommended) - Offers high-quality translations with enterprise-grade reliability
   - OpenAI - Alternative if you don’t have Azure access
   - For detailed info on supported models, see [Supported Models and Services](../..)

1. AI Vision Resource (Optional):
   - Azure AI Vision - Enables translation of text inside images
   - If not set up, the translator will automatically use [Markdown-only mode](./getting_started/markdown-only-mode.md)
   - Recommended for projects with images containing text that needs translating

1. Configuration Steps:
   - Follow our [Azure AI setup guide](./getting_started/set-up-azure-ai.md) for detailed instructions

    ```bash
    .venv\scripts\activate
    ```

    - On Linux/macOS:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install the package:

    ```bash
    pip install co-op-translator
    ```

1. Configure Credentials:

    - Create a `.env` file with your API keys and endpoints

    ```bash
    translate -l "ko ja fr"
    ```

_(Replace `"ko ja fr"` with the language codes you want.)_

### GitHub Actions Setup

For automated translations triggered on repository pushes, configure GitHub Actions:

- Place your workflow file in `.github/workflows` in your repository. No local installation is required.
- Guides:
  - [GitHub Actions Guide (Public Repositories & Standard Secrets)](./getting_started/github-actions-guide/github-actions-guide-public.md) - For most public or personal repositories using standard repository secrets.

## Responsible AI

Microsoft is dedicated to helping customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing what we’ve learned, and building trust through tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. Many of these resources are available at [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).  
Microsoft’s approach to responsible AI is based on principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Large-scale natural language, image, and speech models—like those used in this example—may sometimes behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive, potentially causing harm. Please review the [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) to understand the risks and limitations.

The best way to reduce these risks is to include a safety system in your architecture that can identify and block harmful behavior. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) offers an independent protection layer to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in your apps and services. Azure AI Content Safety provides text and image APIs to identify harmful material. We also offer an interactive Content Safety Studio where you can explore and test sample code for detecting harmful content across different formats. The following [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) will help you get started with making requests to the service.

Another important factor is overall application performance. For multi-modal and multi-model applications, performance means the system behaves as you and your users expect, including avoiding harmful outputs. It’s important to evaluate your application’s performance using [generation quality and risk and safety metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in).

You can assess your AI application in your development environment using the [prompt flow SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). Whether you have a test dataset or a specific goal, your generative AI outputs are quantitatively measured with built-in or custom evaluators. To start using the prompt flow SDK to evaluate your system, follow the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). After running an evaluation, you can [view the results in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).
