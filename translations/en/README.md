## Overview

**Co-op Translator** lets you quickly translate your educational GitHub content into many languages, making it easy to reach people around the world. When you update your Markdown files, images, or Jupyter notebooks, translations are automatically kept up to date so your educational GitHub content stays current and useful for international users.

See how Co-op Translator organizes translated educational GitHub content:

![Example](../../translated_images/translation-ex.0c8aa6a7ee0aad2b35cddcc110c719baf0afc640e8c5a45540e6c166b9907d91.en.png)

## Quick start

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install the package
pip install co-op-translator
# Translate
translate -l "ko ja fr" -md
```

Docker:

```bash
# Pull the public image from GHCR
docker pull ghcr.io/azure/co-op-translator:latest
# Run with current folder mounted and .env provided (Bash/Zsh)
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env -v "${PWD}:/work" ghcr.io/azure/co-op-translator:latest -l "ko ja fr" -md
```

## Minimal setup

- Create a `.env` file using the template: [.env.template](../../.env.template)
- Set up one LLM provider (Azure OpenAI or OpenAI)
- For image translation (`-img`), also set up Azure AI Vision
- Recommended: If you have translations from other tools, clean them up first to avoid conflicts (for example: `translations/`).
- Recommended: Add a translations section to your README using the [README languages template](./README_languages_template.md)
- See: [Set up Azure AI](./getting_started/set-up-azure-ai.md)

## Usage

Translate all supported types:

```bash
translate -l "ko ja"
```

Only Markdown:

```bash
translate -l "de" -md
```

Markdown + images:

```bash
translate -l "pt" -md -img
```

Only notebooks:

```bash
translate -l "zh" -nb
```

More flags: [Command reference](./getting_started/command-reference.md)

## Features

- Automatic translation for Markdown, notebooks, and images
- Keeps translations updated with source changes
- Works locally (CLI) or in CI (GitHub Actions)
- Uses Azure OpenAI or OpenAI; optional Azure AI Vision for images
- Keeps Markdown formatting and structure intact

## Responsible AI

Microsoft is committed to helping customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing what we've learned, and building trust-based partnerships through tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. Many of these resources are available at [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).
Microsoft's approach to responsible AI is based on our principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Large-scale natural language, image, and speech models‚Äîlike those used in this sample‚Äîcan sometimes behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive, which can cause harm. Please read the [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) to understand the risks and limitations.

The best way to reduce these risks is to include a safety system in your architecture that can detect and prevent harmful behavior. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) provides an independent layer of protection, able to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that let you detect harmful material. There's also an interactive Content Safety Studio where you can view, explore, and try sample code for detecting harmful content across different types. The following [quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) guides you through making requests to the service.
Another important factor to consider is the overall performance of your application. In multi-modal and multi-model applications, performance means that the system works as you and your users expect, including not producing harmful outputs. It's essential to evaluate your application's performance using [generation quality and risk and safety metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in).

You can assess your AI application in your development environment with the [prompt flow SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). Whether you use a test dataset or a specific target, your generative AI application's outputs are measured quantitatively using either built-in or custom evaluators. To start using the prompt flow SDK to evaluate your system, check out the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). After running an evaluation, you can [visualize the results in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).
