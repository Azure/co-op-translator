## Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations such as [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet), and [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin).

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that fits [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/security.md/definition), please report it to us as explained below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, submit them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send an email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). If possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key; you can download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/pgp).

You should receive a reply within 24 hours. If you don’t, please follow up by email to confirm we received your original message. More information is available at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc).

Please include the following information (as much as you can) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the potential issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of the source file(s) related to the issue’s manifestation
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration needed to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

Providing this information will help us triage your report more efficiently.

If you are submitting a bug bounty report, more detailed reports can lead to a higher reward. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/bounty) page for details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages
