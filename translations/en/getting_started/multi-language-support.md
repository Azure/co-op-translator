# 🌐 Multi-language support setup

Before starting the translation process, you can add a table in the README that links to the translated versions of your document. Co-op Translator will automatically update these links during the translation process, allowing users to switch smoothly between different language versions.

For example, if a user visits the Korean README, they can easily switch to other translations like Spanish or Japanese without leaving the translated page.

Here is an example of how the table should look before running the translation:

## Example
